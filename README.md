# Car-Price-Prediction

It an ML model which is on car price prediction the dataset is from kaggle name as vehicle dataset by cardekho. In this I had developed the model with the help of Jupyter notebook and deployed the model end to end with the help of Heroku. 

With the help of PyCharm IDE I had developed the app.py file in which I had used the flask and for the front-end a page is created with the help of HTML.

In order to access the file open app.py to run the python file.

Any changes can be made and can contribute to made it more progressive.
